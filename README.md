Abstract 
This Waste management is one of the serious challenges of the cities, the system now used in cities, 
we continue to use an old and outmoded paradigm that no longer serves the entail of municipalities, 
Still find over spilled waste containers giving off irritating smells causing serious health issues and atmosphere impairment. 
The Smart Waste Management System will simplify, with the Web applications and mobile phone, the solid and hydric waste inspecting process, and
the management system of this presentation's total collection process. The proposed system is a GPS based. 
the suggested device and implementation will track waste storage and monitor the vehicle's waste driver. 
This method helps to make the customer aware of accountability behind the job such as the system for solid waste inspection and management
and integrating communications technology for truck control systems such as GPS .
